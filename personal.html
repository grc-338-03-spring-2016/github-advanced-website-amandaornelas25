    <div class="About"> Some of my interests include hiking, playing sports, going to the beach, wathching Dodger games, taking trips to Disneyland, and spending time with my friends, family, and dogs! <br><br>I am currently a Resident Advisor for Cal Poly University Housing, which means I live with over 280 freshmen in the College of Liberal Arts Red Brick, Trinity Hall. I love all my freshmen and it is one of my biggest goals to see them succeed! I will return as a second year advisor this fall in Trinity!<br><br> My top 5 StrengthsQuest strengths are Empathy, Developer, Adaptability, Relator, and Achiever. I love being involved through my major, which is why I joined a competitive Graphic Communication club called TAGA.<br>
