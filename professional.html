    I am apart of a Cal Poly, Graphic Communication chapter called TAGA, also known as the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts.<br> <br>Our chapter writes, prints, binds and manufactures several technical journals that get presented then judged by industry professionals at a specific location each year. This year, we had 7 members of our chapter travel to Memphis Tennessee to represent our school at the TAGA Conference.<br><br>TAGA raised over $5,000 and spent over 150 hours working on our &ldquo;Evolution of Print&rdquo; themed journal. In 2016, our Cal Poly chapter took second place at the TAGA national conference!<br><br>Next year, I will take over as TAGA's Production Coordinator.  As Production Coordinator, I will be in charge of scheduling our journal's production runs and being the main form of communication between our members, our professors, and our advisors throughout the year.</p>
